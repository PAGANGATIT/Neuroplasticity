# Neuroplasticity
This process is brain reorganizationï¼Œ brain cells getting new areas, brain cells representing injured body area becoming diminished and ultimately brain cells regeneration in lucky persons.
Brain reorganization can be thoroughly studied via electroencephalogram(EEG).
By this means, brain maps is extensively redrawn.

To upgrade brain reserve power i.e brain cells regeneration potential, opposite side limbs go exercise respect to dominant side.
As known, right-hand sided persons have left-sided dominant cerebral hemisphere. And, left-hand sided persons possess co-dominant cerebral hemispheres.

Neuroplasticity in every day encounters
In chronic neuropathic syndromes like easy fatiguability, trigeminal neuralgia, polymyalgia rheumatica, phanthom limb, unplanned neuroplasticity cause them.
In those cases, small minor exercise in pain-affected side reduce the nerve pain dramatically.
e.g for easy fatiguability, frequent leg movements can correct mitochondriopathy.
Chewing exercise can relieve and cure trigeminal electric shocks.

To reduce phanthom limb sensation, ortho surgeon have tried various surgical techniques.
If they failed, what will we do?
To tell correctly, if phanthom limb sensation started, we have to give neurosleeping drugs or assemble false limbs to those patients.
Immediately after surgery, patients are instructed to exercise their missing limbs hourly to daily.
After a week, they acknowledged that perception is reality. This totally eliminate phanthom limb.
