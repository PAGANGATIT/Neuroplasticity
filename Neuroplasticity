# Neuroplasticity
This process is brain reorganization， brain cells getting new areas, brain cells representing injured body area becoming diminished and ultimately brain cells regeneration in lucky persons.
Brain reorganization can be thoroughly studied via electroencephalogram(EEG).
By this means, brain maps is extensively redrawn.

To upgrade brain reserve power i.e brain cells regeneration potential, opposite side limbs go exercise respect to dominant side.
As known, right-hand sided persons have left-sided dominant cerebral hemisphere. And, left-hand sided persons possess co-dominant cerebral hemispheres.

Neuroplasticity in every day encounters
In chronic neuropathic syndromes like easy fatiguability, trigeminal neuralgia, polymyalgia rheumatica, phanthom limb, unplanned neuroplasticity cause them.
In those cases, small minor exercise in pain-affected side reduce the nerve pain dramatically.
